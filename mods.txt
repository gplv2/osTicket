Reports mod from Scott Rowley:

- http://sudobash.net/?p=821  version 3.4
- I modded this very nice mod to show nicely on all browsers using css rather than tables with td/tr usage.  On firefox it didn't show correcly but it did on chrome.  So there you go.
- Also took away the layout to a css file using fieldset/legend html tags that suit the job better.
- fixed z-index bug in stock js calendar along the way 

Assigned-to mod from Scott Rowley:
- http://sudobash.net/?p=158 
- Added Assigned-To field , very useful from  -again- the work done by Scott Rowley.  I really like the look of the overview now.

View Message headers mod from -yet again- Scott Rowley!
- http://sudobash.net/?p=657
- This make sure you can view message headers when a ticket has been created via email, very useful for working on the email importer, I wish I had found it earlier.

Auto-assign rules mod from -guess who?- Scott Rowley. ;-)
- http://sudobash.net/?p=505
- Nice add on, makes assigning tickets easier by rules (only from email import feed)!;

Small time fixes:

Close will unassign ticket, from http://sudobash.net/?p=821#comment-1191 :
- Now you may notice that after you close a ticket that is assigned to someone that assignment gets removed. I have found this undesirable.  If you close now the assignment will be kept.
