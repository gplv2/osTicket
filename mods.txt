Reports mod from Scott Rowley:

- http://sudobash.net/?p=821  version 3.4
- I modded this very nice mod to show nicely on all browsers using css rather than tables with td/tr usage.  On firefox it didn't show correcly but it did on chrome.  So there you go.
- Also took away the layout to a css file using fieldset/legend html tags that suit the job better.
- fixed z-index bug in stock js calendar along the way 

Small time fixes:

Close will unassign ticket, from http://sudobash.net/?p=821#comment-1191 :
- Now you may notice that after you close a ticket that is assigned to someone that assignment gets removed. I have found this undesirable.  If you close now the assignment will be kept.
